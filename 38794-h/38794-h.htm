<p>According to <i>The Globe</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Yeo</span>,
in returning thanks after the Poplar
election, shouted to a female interrupter;
"Shut up, you silly cat, shut
up!" To this, we understand, the cat
retorted generously, "My-Yeo!"</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> has forbidden the

called <i>Ferdinand, Prince of
Prussia</i>, on the ground that one
of the characters is a member of
the Prussian Royal Family. We
ourselves should never have dared
to hint that this fact renders the
play unfit for the public.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="sc">Durham</span> lectured last
week on Explosives as an aid to
Gardening; but many persons
think that the quiet man who
does not lose his temper gets
better results.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Burglars, last week, broke
into a synagogue at Newcastle-on-Tyne
and removed practically
all the articles of value,
including a silver cup and a
pointer. Surprise is expressed
in some quarters that the pointer
should not have given the alarm
by barking.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Living artists sometimes complain
that it is only the Old Masters who
are appreciated nowadays. Authors
would seem to be more fortunate.
Take the following paragraph from
<i>The Bedford Express</i>:&mdash;"On Sunday
the well-known elocutionist, Mr.
<span class="sc">Frederick Duxbury</span>, visited Stevenage.
He preached morning and evening
at the Wesleyan Church, and
in the afternoon he gave a sacred
recital. His principal item on Sunday
afternoon was Coulson Kernahan's
'God and the Ant,' but he
included one or two lesser pieces,
including a chapter from the book of
Job."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was stated last week in the Marylebone
Police Court that there is a
gang of thieves in London who do not
hesitate to steal motor-cars whenever
they find them unattended in the street.
These scoundrels are crafty enough not
to pick up the cars and put them under
their arm, for they realise that this
might attract attention, but they just
jump in and drive off.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We are glad to note a renewed outcry
against the unearthly noises made by
many motor-car hooters. If they must
run over us, the least they can do is to
let us die in peace.</p>

<p>It seems a pity that so little is done
to encourage the growing love of art
among the criminal classes. The
Italian gentleman who guarded "La
Gioconda" so carefully has not been
so much as thanked for his pains, and
now it is stated that six persons have
been arrested in Paris and Brussels for
removing art objects from the admittedly
unsafe custody of museums.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Stout residents of Cornforth, Durham,
having protested against the narrowness
of some of the gateways on the local
paths, the parish council has decided to
widen them. It was found that this
would be more economical than to send
these citizens to Marienbad to have
their bulk reduced.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Publishers are continually making
finds, and Messrs. <span class="sc">Duckworth and Co.</span>
have been peculiarly fortunate. In
their current list they announce the
publication of "Lost Diaries" and
"The Lost Road."</p>

36.5 days." This, we need
scarcely tell our readers, works
out at 5.06849315 eggs per bird

<h2 class="sans">THE PERFECT CONDUCTOR.</h2>

<p>"<span class="sc">Good morning</span>, Sir," he said, as I boarded a leviathan
one day last week. "What a beautiful morning, isn't it?
What can I have the pleasure of doing for you?" He
daftly pulled half-a-dozen tickets from his stock and permitted
me to inspect them.</p>

<p>"Fresh in this morning, Sir," he continued. "White,
one penny; a great many people prefer them because they
go well with any colour. For the blue ones we are asking
twopence; they have only the same amount of information
but take you twice as far. Sweet shade, isn't it?" He
stepped back and held one up to the light for my benefit.</p>

<p>"Well, I really only wanted a pennyworth, but I <i>must</i>
have one of the blue ones&mdash;they <i>are</i> attractive, as you say.
I shall keep it in memory of you."</p>

<p>"Very good of you, Sir. You won't mind my making
a little hole in it? A mere matter of form; and the bell,
which rings to announce the conclusion of the operation, is,
as you will notice, quite musical. A sovereign? I shall
be delighted to change it for you." He gave me the correct
change, bowed, and turned to answer a lady passenger.</p>

<p>"Have we passed Sloane Street?" she had enquired.</p>

<p>"We passed it at least five minutes ago, madam. Were
you wishing to alight there?"</p>

<p>"I was," replied the lady; "but don't trouble&mdash;I can
walk back."</p>

<p>He was horrified at the thought.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my dear madam," he protested. Turning
to the little ventilator-window by which he could communicate
with the driver, he rapped. "William," he called,
"a lady here desired to get down at Sloane Street. Do
you mind...?"</p>

<p>"Charles," responded the driver, stopping the 'bus, "you
know our one ambition is to please the passengers who so
trustfully commit themselves to our charge. Mingle my
regrets with yours, as representing the Company, that we
should have omitted clearly to intimate when we were in
the vicinity of Sloane Street. We will lose no time in
correcting the error."</p>

<p>"William," said Charles, "it is only what I should have
expected of you. It is the least we can do." William
turned the 'bus carefully and ran quickly back, to the
admiration of the other passengers, who murmured
unanimous approval of such graceful courtesy.</p>

<p>"This," announced Charles, as we pulled up after a while,
having recovered the lost ground, "is South Kensington
Station. We stay here one full minute for the advantage
of any person who wishes to visit the neighbourhood; after
which we shall proceed, if all goes well, to Putney, taking with
us perchance those who have business in that direction."</p>

<p>I prepared to alight, and Charles shook my hand warmly.</p>

<p>"Speaking for William and myself, Sir, representing the
Company," he said with emotion, "we are indeed sorry to
lose you. It would have given us both great pleasure
could your presence have graced the remainder of the journey.
Still, doubtless your private affairs compel you to sever this
so charming acquaintanceship, and on some future occasion
I trust we may again meet?"</p>

<p>"I trust so, Charles," I answered. "Farewell."</p>

<p>"<i>Au revoir</i>," said Charles, waving a hand. Sorrowfully
I left him, hearing as I departed his dulcet tones addressing
the passers-by: "If anyone would care to step on, we are
going to...."</p>

<h2 class="sans">MANNERS FOR PARENTS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch,</span>&mdash;Instead of writing all this nonsense
about the behaviour of boys at school, why doesn't someone
write about the behaviour of parents at school&mdash;at
their son's school, I mean? That is a subject which really
requires ventilation, for the behaviour of most parents
at school is <i>positively mouldy</i>.</p>

<p>Of course it's very nice for your people to come down
and see you and all that, but there's a good deal of
anxiety about it which might easily be avoided, and I have
therefore written out a few simple <span class="sc">Rules for Parents
at School</span> which I hope you will publish.</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>(I.) Do not greet your son upon your arrival with
"Well, boysie," or some such rotten expression as that. It's
the sort of thing that it may take him years to live down.</li>

<li>(II.) Do not insist upon attaching the son of your old
friend Smith to the party. Old Smith may be all right,
but young Smith may be in a House you can't mix with,
or something like that.</li>

<li>(III.) Do not say to your son, of someone else's cap,
"That's a pretty cap; why don't you have one like it?"
because it's probably either the First XI. colours, or the
cap of a House you wouldn't be seen dead in.</li>

<li>(IV.) Do not tell the House Master how well your son
played in the boys' cricket match last summer holidays.
Your son is probably a perfect rabbit, and the master is
certain to know it.</li>

<li>(V.) Do not discuss such subjects as "The Public School
and the Development of Character" with the masters in
your son's presence. It's very unpleasant to have the
development of your character discussed. In fact it's
hardly decent.</li>

<li>(VI.) Do not treat a member of the XI. as if he were
an ordinary person; and&mdash;</li>

<li>(VII.) For Heaven's sake don't walk across Great Green.
Only fellows who have been in the XI. two seasons may
do so, yet I've known parents wander all over it before
their sons could stop them, and only laugh when told
what they had done!</li></ul>

<p>Hoping you will publish this, as I think you ought
to do,</p>

  <p class="ind2">Yours truly, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="sc">Chubb</span> Minor.

<h2>MY HEROES.</h2>

<p>Every day of my life I am more and
more impressed by the genius of two
men. These men are <span class="sc">Gutenberg</span> and
<span class="sc">Morse</span>. <span class="sc">Gutenberg</span> invented printing
and <span class="sc">Morse</span> was more or less in at the
birth of telegraphy. What should we
do without either?</p>

<p>It is morning and I turn to the
paper. It happens to be <i>The Daily
Graphic</i>. What do I find? I find
<span class="sc">Gutenberg</span> and <span class="sc">Morse</span> once more in
collaboration. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<h3>"MR. BALFOUR LOSES HIS WAY.</h3>

<p class="author2"><span class="sc">Cannes</span>, Monday.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Mr. Balfour paid a visit yesterday in pouring
rain to Mr. Chamberlain at the Villa
Victoria. Mr. Balfour lost his way, and
passing the house strolled along the Fréjus
road, scanning the name of every house until
he found a chauffeur who directed him to the
Villa Victoria. Subsequently Mr. Balfour returned
to the Hotel Continental and motored
out to dinner.&mdash;Central News."
</p></blockquote>

<p>What, privileges we enjoy, we moderns!
Five hundred years ago, four hundred,
the world would have been in ignorance
of any event of this kind. Statesmen
would have lost their way in
foreign towns and no one at home
would have known. Think of the
privation! But now, not only, thanks
to <span class="sc">Gutenberg</span>, do we know it and
think accordingly, but, thanks to <span class="sc">Morse</span>,
we know it the next day and our thrills
are not delayed.</p>

<p>So much for the morning.</p>

<p>It is a few minutes later&mdash;evening.
Not really evening, because it is before
lunch, but evening enough for the
Tenth Muse, bless her! I open <i>The
Evening News</i> and what do I find?
<span class="sc">Gutenberg</span> alone; but how full of
matter! Thus:&mdash;</p>

<h3>"SEVEN.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The mystic number seven is curiously associated
with the baby daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Knight, of Old Swinford, Worcestershire.</p>

<p>She was born at the Seven Stars Hotel at
the seventh hour of the seventh day of the
seventh month.</p>

<p>There were seven customers in the bar when
her birth was announced, seven persons were
present at the christening, and there are seven
letters in her Christian name.</p>

<p>Her father is the eldest of seven children
and her mother the youngest of seven. She
has seven uncles."
</p></blockquote>

<p>There's for you! But of course this
is not enough. The chronicler, try as
he might, is but a scamper after all.
Not only were there seven customers
in the bar, but each had had seven
drinks. Whiskey (there are seven
letters in whiskey, spelt my way)
punch. Each had a slice of lemon and
there were seven pips in the lemon.
Of the seven uncles each had a watch,
making seven watches, and a cigar
case, making seven cigar-cases. So it
might go on for ever.</p>

<p>Similarly the nine deported Labour
leaders arrived in the Thames nine
minutes after somebody else and nine
minutes before somebody else. The
term "dock-berth" has nine letters in
it, and Nine Elms is on the Thames too.
Whew!</p>

<h2 class="sans">INTERVIEWING FATHER.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Sir George</span> is not a nice man. He
is a mercenary, narrow-minded person.
I never really liked him, but then he
never really liked me. However, he is
Miranda's father, so I decided to interview
him. The interview took place at
his office. He waved me to a chair,
and, as it seemed all that I was likely
to get, I took it.</p>

<p>"Well?" Sir George grunted.</p>

<p>His tone indicated an unfriendly
spirit, so I retorted, "Well."</p>

<p>There was a slight pause.
Then he said, rather aggressively.
"I never lend money."</p>

<p>"I suspected it," I replied;
"I practically never borrow
money, but that is my misfortune
and not my fault."</p>

<p>"Then what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"You have a daughter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have," he interrupted.</p>

<p>"I knew we should find a
common basis of agreement.
Miranda is unmarried; I am
unmarried."</p>

<p>"You suggest marrying my
daughter?"</p>

<p>"I make no suggestion, but
the idea had crossed my mind."</p>

<p>"Can you keep a wife?"</p>

<p>"I never lost one yet. I think
that with a little tact&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean, have you any
money?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen shillings and fourpence,"
I answered, producing
that sum as evidence of my
<i>bona fides</i>.</p>

<p>"That is not a very large
capital on which to start married
life."</p>

<p>"True, but I'm not mercenary.
Yet perhaps, as we seem to have
drifted on to the question of
money, I might mention that I
have property&mdash;house property."</p>

<p>"I don't believe much in house
property in these days."</p>

<p>"I don't either. Though I lay no
particular stress on the matter, I also
have some mortgages."</p>

<p>"I don't care much about mortgages."</p>

<p>"I agree with you. Beastly things,
I call them."</p>

<p>"What income do you derive from
the property and the mortgages?"</p>

<p>"I don't exactly derive any income
from either. You see, the two things
go together&mdash;I mean the property and
the mortgages. I don't fancy the
mortgagees get much income from the
property, though I suppose they try
their best. Perhaps, strictly speaking,
I can hardly call the property mine
since the mortgagees took possession.
The mortgages however are undoubtedly
mine. I created them, you
know."</p>

<p>Sir George rose pompously, so I
went on at once:</p>

<p>"I have some shares. I should like
your opinion on them."</p>

<p>"What kind of shares?"</p>

<p>"The usual kind&mdash;paper, but quite
nice artistic designs on them."</p>

<p>"In what companies?"</p>

<p>"I forget the names of the companies,
but I think that they had something
to do with rubber."</p>

<p>"Then you can take my advice and
sell them."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," I said, "if that
means that you'll buy them. I always
thought that I should eventually find
someone to help me out."</p>

<p>"I will not buy your shares. But
before I finally close this interview I
should like to know, as a matter of
curiosity, on what you live?"</p>

<p>"Meat and things, like other people.
I'm no vegetarian."</p>

<p>"I mean, how do you obtain food
and clothes? I see that you do
wear clothes. At present I'm a little
puzzled."</p>

<p>"It's a matter which has often
puzzled me. I get them somehow.
Sometimes I work and sometimes, but
not very often, I get paid for my work.
I believe that if I were married I could
earn more."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I couldn't very well
earn less."</p>

<p>"Then am I to understand that you
have practically no income?"</p>

<p>"If it comes to that, has Miranda
any income?"</p>

<p>"My daughter will have what I
choose to allow her."</p>

<p>"And I shall have what I choose to
earn, so it seems that we should be
fairly well matched."</p>

<p>"Sir, I consider your request
to marry my daughter an impertinence,
and the flippancy with
which you have conducted this
interview an insult."</p>

<p>"Sir George," I said impressively,
"be just before you are
generous. If you think over
the matter calmly you will recognise
that I have made no such
request. You are an older man
than I, so I pass over anything
that you may have said in the
heat of the moment. I am
willing to part friends."</p>

<p>For a moment I thought he
would burst. He ignored my
outstretched hand and almost
shouted, "I don't care how we
part, so long as we do part.
You will oblige me by not seeing
or communicating with my
daughter again."</p>

<p>As I was passing through the
door I remarked, "Without making
any rash promises, I will
endeavour to oblige you. I
gather, as much from your demeanour
as anything else, that
you do not favour me as a suitor
for your daughter's hand. As a
matter of fact, I look with equal
disfavour on you as a possible
father-in-law. My real object
in seeking this interview was to
remove any misapprehension you might
have on the subject."</p>

<p>When I was well outside the door,
laughter really took hold of me for the
first time since Miranda refused to
marry me.</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR LITERARY ADVICE DEPARTMENT.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Candid</span> advice given to the literary
aspirant on easy terms by an old
journalist. His fame is world-wide, but
he prefers to be known as <span class="sc">The Old Nib</span>.
Anyone sending him threatening letters
will be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Frankly, <span class="sc">Lancelot</span>, your <i>Passionate
Pangs; or, Heart Throbs of a Retired
Government Clerk</i>, will never bring you
in a large income. You say friends
have praised them highly, and you point
out that <span class="sc">Tennyson</span> had to wait years
for recognition. Well, you must do the
same. You could not have a better
precedent.</p>

<p>You have a strong grasp of a situation,
<span class="sc">Benjamin</span>, and the scene where <i>Uncle
Henry</i> slips on the butter slide is quite
thrilling. But you must compress a
little and avoid certain faults of style.
"She hove a sigh" is wrong; and I do
not like "'Pshaw,' he <i>shouted</i>"; I do not
think it could be done. I tried myself
in my bath and swallowed a lot of
soapy water. Pray be more careful.</p>

<p>I certainly like to hear from such an
enthusiastic reader as <span class="sc">Wigwam</span>. His
idea, of going to a fancy-dress ball
dressed in a number of old copies of
<i>Wopple's Weekly</i> is excellent and, if they
let him in, ought to be a great success.
I hope he wins the hair comb. As to
his verses I have often seen worse.
With a rhyming dictionary (for rhyming)
and an ordinary one (for spelling)
<span class="sc">Wigwam</span> should go far.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Angelina's</span> poem shows a nice domestic
feeling which I appreciate. In
these days of Suffragettes it is not every
authoress who will say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"I like to see a familiar face</p>
<p>And I think home is a beautiful place."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But though "mother," as she says,
is a very beautiful word it does not
rhyme with "forever." "Other,"
"brother" and "smother" are the
rhymes that I always recommend.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leonidas</span> has made a great improvement
since I had to speak to him so
severely last spring. <i>Sly Sarah</i> is
quite a clever tale, and before very long
<span class="sc">Leonidas</span> will find himself writing for
<i>Soapy Bits</i> and papers of that calibre.
Of this I am sure. His characterization
is strong, his style is redolent of
<i>bravura</i> and his general atmosphere is
<i>fortissimo</i>. The character of the archdeacon
might be improved; indeed, if
<span class="sc">Leonidas</span> is going to send it to <i>The
Diocesan Monthly</i>, I should say it must
be improved. Why should he slap
<i>Sarah's</i> face? No reason is given for
this, and it is surely a very questionable
action. Human nature may be
human nature, but archdeacons are
archdeacons. By the way there is only
one <i>l</i> in spoonful.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Henry</span> must be careful. This is the
third time he has sent me his epic.
There are limits.</p>

<p>There is not much demand for tales
of this description, <span class="sc">Hopeful</span>. But as
you say you like writing them I do not
see who is to prevent you. If you can
get the permission of the local authorities
by all means give a reading at the
Home for the Half-Witted.</p>

<p>I have no doubt <span class="sc">Clapham Rover</span>
means well, but he has a lot to learn.
There are no events of any kind in the
three tales he sends me. The only
thing that ever happens is that the
hero is kicked downstairs. Even then
he lies prostrate in the hall for two
days. Surely the maids might have
swept him up. <span class="sc">Clapham Rover</span> must
remember the great words of <span class="sc">Demosthenes</span>
when he swallowed a pebble on
the sea beach: "Action, action, and
again action." He was thinking of
lawyers, of course, but his words have
a lesson for us all.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ingenuous</span> is the exact opposite of
<span class="sc">Clapham Rover</span>. I rise from his tale
an absolute wreck. "Splash, she was
in the river;" "plonk, he was on the
floor;" "whiz, a bullet shot past him."
<span class="sc">Ingenuous</span> must really go more quietly
and make a little less noise. Why not
write a few essays on some of our lesser
known female didactic writers, or some
such subjects as "People one is surprised
to hear that Dr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span> never
met?" It would do him a lot of good.
But above all he must study that
master of Quietism, the incomparable
author of <i>The Woman's Touch</i>, <i>The
Silent Preacher</i>, <i>Through a College
Key-hole</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Parsifal</span> has pained me very much.
He sent me a long poem, and after I had
given him a very detailed criticism I
discovered that he had simply copied
out a poem of <span class="sc">Wordsworth's</span> familiar
to us all from our earliest childhood.
I have lost his address, so I cannot tell
him privately what I think of him, but
it was a dirty trick.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ciudad Rodrigo</span> (I don't know why
he calls himself that; he writes from
Balham) sends me an essay on <span class="sc">George
Borrow</span>. It follows with great fidelity
the line of established fact, never deviating
into the unknown. After reading
it I felt that I did not want to hear
any more about <span class="sc">George Borrow</span> for a
long time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arrière Pensée</span>, <span class="sc">Tootles</span>, <span class="sc">Pongo</span>
and <span class="sc">Hugging</span>: see answer to <span class="sc">Ciudad
Rodrigo</span>.</p>

<p>I did an injustice to <span class="sc">Parnassian</span> in
my answer to him last week. Owing
to a misprint I was made to say that
"his poems were written" (which they
were not, but typed, and very excellently
typed too). What I meant to say was
that his poems were rotten. Sorry.</p>

<h2 class="sans">BELLES LETTRES AND OTHERS.</h2>

<p>Most of us have been startled to
observe how very far real life falls short
of the standard of books. The realisation
has come home to me with great
force after reading <i>whispers of Passion</i>, a
collection of love-letters by "Amorosa,"
which I could not refrain from comparing
with certain authentic love-letters
(as I suppose I must call them)
which happen to be in my possession.</p>

<p>What a contrast! What a melancholy
contrast!</p>

<p>Here, for example, is the tender
opening of one of "Amorosa's" efforts:</p>

<p class="block">"<span class="sc">Beloved,</span>&mdash;This morning I saw
the sun rise from behind the grey hills
that rampart our secluded vale. Slowly,
almost imperceptibly, as I watched,
the sombre robes of the Night were
irradiated and enrosed by the mysterious
fires of the Dawn. And herein, my
dear one, I seemed to grasp a deathless
symbol of the awakening of Love
between us, the first slow gilding of
our grey lives by the roseate glamour
of romance...."
</p>

<p>And so on. Now read this, taken
from one in my own collection treating
of the same subject:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"<span class="sc">Dear Woqgles,</span>&mdash;How <i>dare</i> you
hint that I'm lazy? As a matter of
fact I saw the sunrise only this morning,
which reminds me of a story. I daresay
you know it already. A small boy decided
to keep a diary, and the first entry he
made was: '<i>1st January&mdash;Got up at
8.15.</i>' His mater objected to this on the
ground that <i>got up</i> was too slangy.
'Look at the sun,' she said. 'The sun
doesn't <i>get up</i>; it <i>rises</i>.' The same
evening, after the boy had gone to bed,
she looked at the diary again. There
was only one other entry: '<i>Set at 9.</i>'
</p>

<p class="block">Not much of a yarn, is it, Woggles?
But still it's good enough for you...."</p>

<p>Or consider this beautiful conclusion:</p>

<p class="block">
"... Dear, I am all thine. My
soul calls to thee across the night; the
beating of my heart cries through the
darkness&mdash;Thine, thine, thine!</p>

<p class="block">Good night, adored one, good night.
</p>

<p class="ind4"><span class="sc">Amorosa.</span>"</p>

<p>And contrast it with the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"... And now I must dry up or I
shan't be in bed by midnight, and the
old man will lose his hair and say I'm
ruining my precious constitution. Ta
ta. Be a good infant.
</p>

<p class="ind4">Yours, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="sc">Madge</span>."</p>

<p>"Amorosa's" lover appears to have
sent her a bracelet, and must have felt
richly repaid when he received this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"... As I clasped the slender
circlet around my wrist I seemed to
hear a voice which said, 'This is pure
gold; let your love be pure. It is an
emblem of infinity; let your trust be
infinite. It is a pledge of fidelity; let
your faithfulness be immutable...."
</p>

<p>But this is how Madge expresses
herself on a similar occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"... Thanks very much for the
bracelet. It seems pretty decent...."
</p>

<p>Let me give two other extracts which
happen to treat of similar themes.
Here is the first:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"... I heard music surging in
great waves of divine beauty from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>
Belnobbio's 'cello, and, magically,
wonderfully, it lured and compelled my
thoughts, beloved one, to you. In all
those immortal harmonies I heard your
voice; the Master's rapt features faded
into mist, and I saw instead your own
grave, strong face. Tell me, what is
this power which can so converge all
beauties to one centre?..."
</p>

<p>And here is the second:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"... I went to hear Kranzer
yesterday, and oh, Woggles, I tell you,
he is the edge, the very ultimate edge!
I <i>rave</i> over him day and night. I'm
madly, head-over-heels, don't-know-how-to-express-it
in love with him.
I'm going to throw you over and
follow him about all round the world,
and whenever I get the chance just lie
down and let him wipe his boots on
me. So&mdash;resign yourself to it; you'll
probably never see again,
</p>

<p class="author1">Your fatally smitten
      <span class="sc">Madge</span>."</p>

<p>Occasionally, it is true, there occurs
in these deplorable letters just a touch
of sentiment, but how crudely, how
prosaically expressed. Immediately
after the passage quoted above, for
instance, I find this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"P.S.&mdash;Dear old boy, you don't mind
when I rag you, do you? Here's just
a teeny-weeny &nbsp;×&nbsp; for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M."
</p>

<p>How does "Amorosa" phrase such
a sentiment?</p>

<p class="block">
"... My lips cannot touch your
lips, but my soul seeks yours, and in
that spiritual embrace there is something
of eternity."
</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>(<span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</h4>

<p><i>House of Lords, Monday, February
23rd.</i>&mdash;Temporarily relieved from
thoughts of Ulster or meditations upon
Marconi, House gave itself up to bright
debate on question not less attractive
because of spice of personality. Spice
acquired additional piquancy since it
was not supposed to be there. Its
absence was indeed formally insisted
upon. "Oh no, we never mention him.
His name is never heard." All the
same, as debate went forward, names
<i>did</i> occur. Glances, furtively
shot from side to side of
House, casually rested upon
particular seats, whether
empty or occupied.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 430px;"><a href="images/173-1000.png"><img src="images/173-430.png" width="430" height="479" alt="Lord Crewe (to Lord Selborne on his way to the Debate on the Sale of Honours)." /></a>
<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span> (to Lord <span class="sc">Selborne</span> on his way to the Debate on the Sale
of Honours).</i> "I trust we shall have no stone-throwing."</p>

<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Selborne</span>.</i> "I'm entirely with you. Too much stained-glass
about, what?"</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Selborne</span> introduced subject
by moving Resolution
condemning principle that a
contribution to Party funds
should be a consideration to
a Minister recommending
to the Sovereign bestowal of
a titular honour. Subject
delicate one to handle. As
<span class="sc">Selborne</span> admitted, <span class="sc">Willoughby
de Broke</span> and
<span class="sc">Ribblesdale</span> in succession
concurring, it was not a
Party question. Notorious
that since the days of Lord
<span class="sc">North</span> both political parties
are tarred with same brush.
Through difficult circumstances
<span class="sc">Selborne</span> adroitly
picked his way in lively
speech. Sorely handicapped
by Resolution, the effect of
which, even with assistance
of other House, would,
as <span class="sc">Ribblesdale</span> pointed
out, be absolutely nil. "In
the end," he said, "both
Houses would be only expressing
a pious, almost a
Pharisaical opinion."</p>

<p>This conceded, the Lords, having no
work to do, might have done much
worse than devote sitting to breezy
debate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Willoughby de Broke</span> at his best
in his enunciation of principles upon
which, were he dispenser of honours in
the Radical camp, he would choose his
peers. Whilst taking broad view of
case on eugenic principles, he would be
inclined to make selection in favour of
childless candidates.</p>

<p>"The sons of newly-created Radical
peers are," he shrewdly remarked,
"almost certain to be Tories, while a
Radical grandson of a Radical peer is
a phenomenon never seen."</p>

<p>Incidentally the bold Baron took
occasion to remark that his own title
was conferred upon an ancestor in
reward for active part taken in placing
the Tudor dynasty on the throne.
Some noble lords, whose patent to
peerage is of rather more recent date,
whilst agreeing generally with his
views, thought this remark superfluous.
Why drag in the Tudors?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Willoughby's</span> graphic account of an
interview with the agent of a moneyed
applicant for honours was capped by
<span class="sc">Ribblesdale</span>, who confided to listening
Senate particulars of occasions when, as
a Whip he had from time to time been
"approached."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Milner</span>, shocked by what he regarded
as frivolity, proposed to treat
the subject "with a slight approach to
seriousness." Proposal cast a blight
over proceedings which were hurried to
conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Selborne's</span> Resolution
agreed to with verbal amendment.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Resemblance
of House of Commons to
the sea never more strikingly illustrated
than at to-night's sitting. For five
hours and a half deadliest calm reigned.
Benches less than half full. Questions
droned through appointed period.
House got into Committee of Supply
on Civil Service estimates. Votes for
Colonial Service offered occasion for
debate on Camel Corps disaster in
Somaliland last August. <span class="sc">Lulu</span> defended
in detail the policy and action
of his department. At half-past eight,
talk still dragging slow length along, he
moved closure. Division on proposal
to reduce the estimate, equivalent to
vote of censure, ran Government
majority up to 125.</p>

<p>Suddenly scene changed. It was the
mid-dinner hour, period at which House
is as a rule dismally empty. The four-hundred-and-seventy
Members who had
taken part in the division, instead of
fleeing in accordance with custom as if
fire had broken out, made for their
seats, whence rose the buzz
of excited talk that presages
a tempest.</p>

<p>The miracle was worked
by Ulster. <span class="sc">Falle</span>, having
by favour of fortune at
ballot-box secured portion
of sitting as Private Member's
property, moved Resolution
calling upon <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span>, forthwith to submit
to House his proposals
for alteration of Government
of Ireland Bill. Opposition
mustered in support.
Ministerialists whipped up
to last man. When, following
mover and seconder of
Resolution, <span class="sc">Premier</span> appeared
at the table he was
welcomed by shout of exultant
cheering. Significant
contrast with his reception
when, a fortnight earlier, he
stood in same place and
seemed inclined to dally
with proposal for exclusion
of Ulster. Instinctively, or
through whispered information,
Ministerialists knew
he was now, as they put it,
"going straight."</p>

<p>Their most sanguine expectation
justified. <span class="sc">Premier</span>
in fine fighting form.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen opposite," he scornfully
said, "seem to think we here can be
likened to a beleaguered garrison, driven
by the stress of warfare into an untenable
position with failing supplies, with
exhausted ammunition, with shaken
nerves, and that it is for them, the
minority of this House, to dictate the
terms of capitulation that are to determine
whether we are to be allowed to
surrender with or without the honours
of war."</p>

<p>That sufficed to indicate his position.
Whilst disclosure increased enthusiasm
on Ministerial side it correspondingly
inflamed passion on benches opposite.</p>

<p>There was an anxious moment when
fisticuffs seemed imminent across the
table in close proximity to shocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>
Mace. <span class="sc">Carson</span> making interruption
(one of a continuous series), <span class="sc">Premier</span>
thought it was <span class="sc">Walter Long</span>, and
severely enjoined him to restrain himself.
<span class="sc">Long</span> hotly retorted that he had
not spoken. Angry cheers and counter-cheers
resounded in opposing camps.
<span class="sc">Premier</span>, accepting assurance of his
mistake, apologised. Fisticuffs postponed.</p>

<p>Warned by experience, <span class="sc">Premier</span> took
no notice when <span class="sc">Moore of Armagh</span>
shouted, "Why do you funk a General
Election?" or when later he received
from same source disclaimer of
belief in his sincerity; or when
another Ulster Member characterised
forceful passage in his
speech as "Tomfoolery."</p>

<p>Fresh roar of cheering broke
over excited host of Ministerialists
when by way of last word <span class="sc">Premier</span>
declared, "We are not going at
the eleventh hour to betray a
great cause."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Proverbially
swift descent from sublime to
ridiculous. Demand of Opposition
for instant disclosure of
Ministerial plan altering Home
Rule Bill met by Amendment
from Liberal side declaring confidence
in Government. This
carried by majority of 73. When
put as substantial Resolution
eleven o'clock had struck. No
opposed business may be taken
after that hour. House accordingly
forthwith adjourned. Record
of night's business in Journals of
House prepared for perusal of
posterity is comprehended in word
"That&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;House puzzled by
question on Paper standing in
name of <span class="sc">H. P. Croft</span>. Member
for Christchurch desires "to ask
the Secretary of State for the
Colonies whether he has received
petitions in favour of immediate
legislation dealing with imported
plumage through all or any of the
Prime Ministers of the States of
Australia."</p>

<p>How, why and under what circumstances
plumage should be "imported
through" Prime Ministers of the
Australian Commonwealth no one can
guess. Generally agreed that, if such
painful procedure actually be the
Colonial custom, prohibitive legislation
cannot be too soon undertaken.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sydney Holland</span>, for many years
the prop and stay of the London
Hospital, has taken his seat in the
House of Lords on accession to the
Viscountcy of Knutsford. Apart from
hereditary claim, he is the ideal type of
the class of peer whom reformers on
both sides look to for restoration of
the prestige and usefulness of the
Upper Chamber. Nevertheless it is
hoped he will not give up to Westminster
what was meant for mankind&mdash;the
splendid devotion of capacity
and energy to the service of the sick
poor of London.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE WEDDING PRESENT.</h2>

<p>"At last," I said, putting down my newspaper, "there
is hope for England. Here is a man who announces his
approaching marriage and hopes that wedding presents will
not be sent."</p>

<p>"Pooh," said the lady of the house.</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "do you say 'pooh'?"</p>

<p>"Because," she said, "it's not a bit of good hoping for
anything of, the sort. You might just as well abolish
weddings at once. People won't go to one unless they
have a chance of seeing their own present and admiring it
so much that the detective begins to suspect them."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "isn't the detective splendid? Nobody
ever fails to spot him, and yet there he is every time, firmly
convinced that everybody takes him for the bridegroom's
uncle or the bride's godfather by a former marriage, or
something of that sort. I really do feel I couldn't do without
the detective."</p>

<p>"There you are," she said. "You can't have the detective
without the presents."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, "we'll let presents go on a bit
longer and chance it."</p>

<p>"And don't you forget," she said firmly, "that you've
got to choose a present for George Henderson to-day."</p>

<p>"George Henderson?" I said dreamily. "Do you think
George Henderson <i>wants</i> a present? Isn't he the sort
which 'hopes that wedding presents will not be sent'?
I've always felt he had a look in his eye which said, 'Dear
old chap, I shall be married some day.&mdash;Whatever you do,
don't send me a present.' Haven't you felt that about
him, too?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I haven't. In fact George has always
seemed to me the very man for a present. And now he's
going to be married. It's the chance of a lifetime."</p>

<p>"Well, then," I said, "if you feel like that <i>you</i> ought to
buy the present. You'll do it better. You'll put more
real feeling into it."</p>

<p>"That may be," she said, "but you 're going to London,
and I'm not. You'll have to do it this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," I said; "have it your own way; but I
warn you I shall buy silver candlesticks."</p>

<p>The two elder girls, who had been listening with eager
interest, now broke in.</p>

<p>"Dad," said Helen to Rosie, "is going to try for his old
candlesticks."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosie; "but you'll see he won't be allowed."</p>

<p>"Cease, babblers," I said. "In earlier and less conjugal
days no wedding was considered complete without my
silver candlesticks. It was all so simple, too. I called at
Gillingham's, wrote out a card, gave an address, and away
went the present. And what's more, they all wrote back
and said it was the one thing they had been longing for."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the lady of the house, "they'll write like
that about anything. At any rate, we won't have candlesticks.
They're quite useless now, you know. Nobody
has candles."</p>

<p>"And that," I said, "is what makes candlesticks so
valuable. There's nothing base and utilitarian about them.
They are appreciated for their beauty, and there's an end
of them. Do, do let me buy a pair for George Henderson."</p>

<p>"No," she said; "the whole of the rest of the silversmith's
art is open to you, but we will <i>not</i> have candlesticks."</p>

<p>"I told you so," said Rosie to Helen.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, accordingly, I wandered into the establishment
of Messrs. Gillingham, jewellers, goldsmiths and
silversmiths, and heaven knows what besides. For a few
moments I steeped myself in the glittering magnificence of
the objects displayed around me. Then a polite and very
well-dressed young man&mdash;not my usual one, but a stranger&mdash;spoke
to me.</p>

<p>"Are you being attended to, Sir?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "not yet. I'm not quite ready for it.
Still, I may as well begin."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>

<p>"What," I said, pointing to a diamond tiara, "is the
price of that?"</p>

<p>Two ladies who were making a purchase turned round
and gazed at me with an awe-struck but approving look.
The young man was evidently much impressed.</p>

<p>"That," he said, "is one of our newest designs. The
stones are all specially selected. The price"&mdash;he studied
the little tag attached to it&mdash;"the price is £1,050; very
cheap for the value."</p>

<p>"It is," I said, "wonderfully cheap. I can't think how
you manage to do it. I will think about it. In the
meantime I should like to see something smaller and not
quite so valuable."</p>

<p>"Is it a wedding present, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Don't," I said, "let us call it a wedding present just
yet." If we do it's sure to turn out a sugar-sifter. Let's
think of it as a mere gift."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>

<p>"Of course we may find that the man to whom we're
going to give it is about to be married, but that will be
only the long arm, won't it?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;I beg your pardon, Sir;"</p>

<p>"A coincidence, you know; and we're not the men to
be put off by coincidences, are we?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir. Would you like to see the manager, Sir?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "the manager would only confuse me.
Show me some silver inkstands and some sugar-jugs&mdash;I
mean some claret-sifters&mdash;that is, some silver decanters,
you know, and some silver fruit-baskets."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir." He went away and returned with an inkstand.</p>

<p>"This," he said, "is a very favourite pattern. It combines
a large inkpot and a match-stand and a rack for the
pens&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," I said; "they never stay in it."</p>

<p>"No, Sir. And there's a little candlestick for sealing-wax&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll have it," I said feverishly. "Put it aside for me
at once. This is really a most remarkable piece of luck."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I'll have a sugar-sifter, too. Any
sugar-sifter will do. I'm only doing it as a concession."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir. Where shall I send them?"</p>

<p>I gave the address with great gusto, and when I reported
the result of my labours at home I said nothing about the
little candlestick. The mere joy of having bought it was
enough for me. Thus George Henderson received from us
his fifth inkstand and his seventh sugar-sifter. He wrote
and said that they were the two things he had most been
wishing for.</p>

<h2>FARES.</h2>

<p>"Is that you, Herbert?" I said in
surprise.</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p>Strange how machinery can influence
a man. The last time I had seen
Herbert he was a rubicund cheerful
gardener. He was now a London taxi-driver,
with all the signs of that
mystery on him: the shabbiness, the
weariness, the disdain.</p>

<p>"Are you glad you gave up gardening?"
I asked him.</p>

<p>"Can't say I am now," he replied.
"There's more money in this, but the
work's too hard. I miss my sleep,
too."</p>

<p>"You can always go back," I said.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he replied. "I'd like
to. This being at every one's beck and
call who happens to have a shilling is
what I'm tired of."</p>

<p>"What about tips?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I get plenty of them," he said.
"In fact, if the clock registers tenpence
or one and fourpence or one and tenpence
I practically always get the odd
twopence. That's all right. It's the
people who don't want to tip but
daren't not do it that I can't stand.
And there are such lots of them.
That's what makes taxi-drivers look so
contemptuous like&mdash;the tips. People
think we want the tips; but there's
a time when we'd rather go without
them than get them like that."</p>

<p>I sympathised with him.</p>

<p>"Then there are the fares who always
know a quicker way than we do.
They're terrors. They keep on tapping
on the glass to direct us, when we know
all about it all the time. It's them
that leads to some of the accidents,
because they take your eyes off the
road."</p>

<p>I sympathised again and made some
mental notes for future behaviour
myself.</p>

<p>"But the pedestrians are the worst,"
he continued.</p>

<p>"The pedestrians?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the people who walk across
the road without giving a thought to
the fact that there might be a vehicle
coming. The people that never learn.
The people that call you names or
make faces at you after you've saved
their silly lives by blowing the hooter
at them. Every minute of the day one
is having trouble with them, and it gets
on one's nerves. It's them that makes
a taxi-driver look old sooner than a
woman."</p>

<p>"So you'll go back to the land?"
I said.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "I'd like
to, but petrol gets into the blood, you
know."</p>

<h2 class="sans">AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<h4>"<span class="sc">The Land of Promise.</span>"</h4>

<p>"<span class="sc">I'm</span> about fed up with God's Own
Country," says the waster in the play,
a youth who, after exchanging a safe
thousand a year at Bridge for the dangerous
delights of "Chemin-de-fer," had
been invited by a stern sire to migrate
to Canada. And even so he had not
been present during the Third Act to
see the things that we saw, or he
would have learnt some more discouraging
facts which are never mentioned
in the philosophy of the emigration-agents;
for example, that the
solitude and wide spaces of the Golden
West seem to induce, even in the honest
native worker, a reversion to the state
of a dragon of the prime. But he had
already seen, in the case of <i>Norah
Marsh</i>, whom poverty had driven to
seek the shelter of her brother's roof
on a Manitoba farm, how the drudgery
and petty jealousies of a narrow Colonial
<i>ménage</i>, the familiar society of hired
hands, and the lack of life's common
amenities, had developed a gently-bred
Englishwoman into a sour-tongued
shrew.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/178-600.png"><img src="images/178-300.png" width="300" height="379" alt="Extract from 'The Prentice' (Manitoba)" /></a>
<p><i>Extract from "The Prentice (Manitoba)
Post"</i>:&mdash;"The wedding was quite an impromptu
affair, the happy pair going straight
to Mr. Taylor's shack, where they are spending
the honeymoon quietly."</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Norah</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss <span class="sc">Irene Vanbrugh</span>.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Frank Taylor</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. <span class="sc">Godfrey Tearle</span>.
</p></div>

<p>Worse was to follow when, as a
sole escape from the bitter spite of
her plebeian hostess, she consented to
marry a barbarian who was looking for
a woman-of-all-work to manage his
primitive shack. Here, having already
mislaid her feminine charm, she loses all
sense of honesty. First, when ordered
to do her household duties&mdash;which
were of the essence of the contract&mdash;she
declines to obey till he uses brute
force; and then, when he demands
of her the attitude of a wife (a very
embarrassing scene), she protests that
this was no part of the bargain.</p>

<p>I can't imagine what she supposed
the bargain was about, if it didn't
require her to be either wife or servant.</p>

<p>Terrorism was the man's simple solution;
but those who looked, in the last
Act, for a tamed and adoring shrew were
to be disappointed. Brute force had
only produced a patient obedience; and
it was not till a damaged crop had
brought them to the edge of ruin that
she consented to become his ministering
angel. But by that time we knew
too well her distaste for Manitoban
methods to believe in the sincerity of
this sudden conversion.</p>

<p>Altogether, after what Mr. <span class="sc">Maugham</span>
has done to my illusions, I have given
up any thought of going to God's Own
Country in search of a larger existence.</p>

<p>The acting was perhaps better than
the play, though the play was good up
to a point. The Second Act, with its
fierce jealousy and wrangling and the
futile efforts of the farmer (admirably
played by Mr. <span class="sc">C. V. France</span>) to intervene
between wife and sister, was
excellent. For the rest, it was the
personality of Mr. <span class="sc">Godfrey Tearle</span>,
as the savage mate of the shrew, that
dominated the scene. There is no
better rough diamond (and he was
really very rough) in the whole stock
of stage-jewellery. Miss <span class="sc">Irene Vanbrugh</span>,
though no actress could have
done more with her part, had less
chance than usual of showing her
particular gift of <i>finesse</i>; and <i>Norah's</i>
character was too inconsistent to
command our sympathy. Not that
we necessarily gave it to the man. Indeed
it was a flaw in the play that our
sympathies were never thoroughly engaged
by either party. We were, of
course, prepared to range ourselves on
the winning side, but there was no
victory. The issue was decided by <i>force
majeure</i> in the shape of a wretched
weed that destroyed the crop.</p>

<p>The situations, though of a rather
strenuous order, gave occasion from
time to time for humorous relief. At
first, when the English servant in the
opening Act rudely interposed with a
facetious comment on the sincerity of
the grief of certain mourners, I feared
lest the humour was going to be distributed
loosely without regard to the
propriety of its mouthpiece. But the
rest was reasonable enough; and my
only complaint about the best repartee
("There's no place like home." "Some
people are glad there isn't") has to do
with its antiquity rather than with its
appropriateness.</p>

<p>I have never been to Manitoba (and,
after seeing <i>The Land of Promise</i>, I am
definitely resolved, as I said, never
to go), so I cannot say whether Mr.
<span class="sc">Maugham's</span> interiors corresponded to
the facts; but their freedom from any
signs of picturesqueness gave them
an air of being the right thing. Life
in these parts no doubt revolves largely
round the simple joys of the stomach.
Seldom have I seen so much eating on
the stage. We began at Tunbridge
Wells with a funeral tea (though perhaps
I ought to pass this over as
taking place outside the Dominion);
then as soon as we get to Dyer (Manitoba)
we had a mid-day dinner, with
washing-up; and then at Prentice
(Manitoba) we were regaled with a
supper of black tea and syrup.</p>

<p>I am confident that there is a great
opening for drama dealing solely with
Life Between Meals. To see people
smoking on the stage is sufficiently
irritating; but, when you are assisting
at a First Night after a sketchy repast
from the grill, all this feeding on the
stage, however frugal the menu, makes
for exasperation.</p>

<p>Finally I must compliment Mr.
<span class="sc">Maugham</span> on his ironical title. For
his play, too, is a thing "of promise"
rather than achievement, if it is to be
judged by the test of the Last Act.
Still, if a play only promises well
enough and long enough&mdash;as this play
did&mdash;that is an achievement in itself.</p>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>I think I could best convey my impression of Miss
<span class="sc">Ethel Sidgwick's</span> work by quoting the advertisement of
a popular magazine which used to proclaim that "these
stories are different." All of Miss <span class="sc">Sidgwick's</span> are this,
though you might possibly be hard put to it to say exactly
how. It is chiefly an affair of style; there is about all of
them a certain dignity of utterance that combines with
their humanity to produce an effect wholly individual and
rare. Take her latest example, <i>A Lady of Leisure</i> (<span class="sc">Sidgwick
and Jackson</span>). There is really very little to arrest
attention in the story itself; the characters are persons
whom you could meet every day, but in Miss <span class="sc">Sidgwick's</span>
hands they become creatures of extraordinary fascination.
The result is a novel by no means easy to criticise; partly
because one is left with the feeling (of course the most
subtle compliment to any author) that the characters have
fashioned it themselves. Time and again one seems to
observe Miss <span class="sc">Sidgwick</span> working towards some inevitable
<i>scène-à-faire</i>, when bounce! off go her people on an entirely
unexpected tack, which you must yet admit to be the
very one they quite obviously would follow. Never was a
cast so incalculably alive. Naturally for this reason its
vagaries (they are almost all in love and generally with the
wrong person) would take too long to recount in detail. I
can only state my personal preference for the group that
consists of the heroine, <i>Violet Ashwin</i>, her father, the
fashionable physician, and her brainless but quite wonderful
mother. I plump for the <i>Ashwin</i> household in short as a
really brilliant contribution to the homes in modern fiction.
I don't say you will find their charm easy of assimilation.
The society of such clever and elusive folk as <i>Violet</i> and
her father is bound to be hard going at first for the
general. But <i>Mrs. Ashwin</i>&mdash;oh, she is a joy, a marvel,
an exasperation! You will delight to read about her.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>The first thing I have to say about <i>Initiation</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>)
is that it might have been written by Dr. <span class="sc">Clifford</span>.
The nice people in it are all Roman Catholics, but a group
of Huguenots or of Calvinistic Methodists would have
served the author's purpose equally well. For <span class="sc">Robert
Hugh Benson</span>, the novelist, has (so to speak) told
Monsignor <span class="sc">Benson</span>, the priest, to mind his own business,
and leave him to his, which is the telling of a story, and
not the advocacy of any particular form of religion. The
second point to notice in the book is that it divides its
characters, and incidentally all characters, into those who
are initiated and those who are not. The initiated are
those who have learnt, chiefly by suffering, the lesson of
life, which is that it treats us as it likes. Because they
have learnt it, they trust, even when they do not understand,
the purpose of the life-giver; because they trust
they do not kick against the pricks. The young Catholic
English gentleman, of whose initiation the story tells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>
suffers prodigiously under two of the greatest misfortunes,
physical and mental, that a man may endure and live. And
yet, when he comes to die, you feel, and he knows, that
they are not misfortunes, but the opening up of the way
of life. The chief cause of his mental suffering, a young
girl of eighteen or nineteen, is described (well on in
the book) as a practically insane egoist. She is, to my
mind, the weak spot in the story. Frankly I don't believe
in her. A girl of her age could not have been so selfishly
cruel, and yet have taken in her world as she did. I
will own that she took me in at first; but that was the
author's fault. He ought not to have let me, as his
reader, think her charming and particularly sympathetic
when he knew all the time that she cared for no one but
herself. I don't think that is playing the game. All the I
same, I like his book.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>Having read Mr. <span class="sc">Reginald Blunt's</span> book, <i>In Cheyne
Walk and Thereabout</i> (<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>), I am now prepared
to pass an examination in the history and the
worthies (or unworthies) of Chelsea. I know that <span class="sc">Don
Saltero</span> was no
Spaniard, but an ardent
collector of childish curiosities
who for a time
kept a coffee-house and
a smoking club of which
"the ornaments and apparatus"
were eventually
offered to <span class="sc">Charles Lamb</span>.
If I am asked about Dr.
<span class="sc">Messenger Monsey</span> I
shall say that he "tried
hard, but with indifferent
success, to popularise his
own method of extracting
teeth by tying one end of
a piece of catgut to the
offending molar and the
other to a perforated
bullet, putting the latter
with a full charge of powder
into a revolver and
then pulling the trigger."
Then again there is <span class="sc">Bartholomew Joseph Alexander de
Dominiceti</span>, Lord <span class="sc">de Cete et de cortesi</span>, Knight of the
Holy Boman Empire and Noble of Venice in terra firma.
How did he with his resounding name come to be in Chelsea
and there establish "baths, fumigatory stoves and sweating
chambers" for the relief of distressed humanity? This question
and a hundred others of a similar nature you will find
answered in Mr. <span class="sc">Blunt's</span> delightful book. Let Mr. <span class="sc">Blunt</span>
take you by the hand and guide you through his beloved
Chelsea. He is the most urbane and the most agreeably
gossiping companion. He will re-introduce you to Sir
<span class="sc">Thomas More</span>, Sir <span class="sc">Hans Sloane</span>; to <span class="sc">Neild</span>, the prison-reformer,
and his son <span class="sc">John</span>, the famous miser; to the
<span class="sc">Carlyles</span> and their servant <span class="sc">Jessie Heddlestone</span>, and a
host of others. And he will remind you that Dr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span>
endeavoured to manufacture Chelsea china, and that his
<i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> always collapsed in the firing. Take my
advice and acquire Mr. <span class="sc">Blunt's</span> book.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>I suspect that <i>Mr. Simpson</i>, who gives his name to the
story <i>Simpson</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>), can hardly have shared my own
exhausting acquaintance with modern fiction, otherwise it
is unlikely that he would have behaved as he did. What
happened was this. <i>Simpson</i>, though on the wrong side of
forty, well off and eminently lovable, was unmarried. Finding
a charming old house in the country, he conceives the
idea of renting it as a kind of bachelor residential club
where he and other congenial cronies can enjoy the life of
ease untroubled by any form of feminism. Well, that, to
start with, one might fairly describe as "asking for it." But
when I add that the old house in question was the property
of a still young and charming widow you will probably
agree with me that poor <i>Simpson</i> hadn't even a dog's
chance from the beginning. It is possible that this fore-dooming
may a little spoil your enjoyment of Miss <span class="sc">Elinor
Mordaunt's</span> otherwise pleasant tale. Naturally, so far
from women being banished from its pages, they simply
abound; and the tale of the progress of the bachelor club
resolves itself into a chronicle of proposals. There is however
an attractive variety about the love affairs, of which
I liked best that of the youngest couple. With two there
is a note of tragedy; and though the courtship of <i>Gilbert
Strong</i>, a respectable country lawyer, and the wild gipsy
whom he marries may strike you as fantastic, the end of
their romance is well told with a fine suggestion of inevitability.
On the whole an agreeable and easy-going
tale, though without any
unusual claim to distinction.</p>

<p>I quite realise that I
have not the shadow
of a case against Mr.
<span class="sc">Algernon Blackwood</span>.
He frankly calls his book
<i>Ten Minute Stories</i>
(<span class="sc">Murray</span>), and that is
exactly what they are.
Nevertheless I did feel
a little aggrieved when
each of them stopped
with a jerk just as I had
become absorbed. One
has a sense of having
been cheated of one's
rights. That is why,
though many of these
sketches are as good as
they can be, I do not
think that the book will be quite so popular as others of
his. But devout Blackwoodsmen will add it to their collections
and re-read the majority of its contents again and
again, as I propose to do. On second thoughts, indeed,
I may say that perhaps Mr. <span class="sc">Blackwood</span> is not so unfair
to his public as I have suggested, for he is one of those
writers who are not dead and done with after a first
perusal. He can pack a vast deal of food for thought even
into a ten-minute story. A good example of what I mean
is to be found in number fifteen of the collection, "Ancient
Lights." Even a scene-shifter at the Savoy Theatre would
believe in fairies after one reading of that. And if, after
studying "If the Cap Fits," you lightly steal a fellow-member's
hat from your club, I shall regard you as a very
reckless dashing fellow. With the awful example of <i>Field-Martin</i>
before me, I would not do it for a fortune. I shall
buy one of those frightful plush hats which you see in shops
but never out of them, and I shall have my name in large
letters on the inside band. And to the hat-waiter's insidious
"This is just as good, Sir," as he offers me some sinister
bowler or topper with a past, I shall reply with gestures of
disgust and threats to write to the committee.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
